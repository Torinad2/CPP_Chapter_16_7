TestScores Class

Write a class named TestScores. The class constructor should accept an array of test

scores as its argument. The class should have a member function that returns the average

of the test scores. If any test score in the array is negative or greater than 100, the

class should throw an exception. Demonstrate the class in a program.

TestScores needs to throw an exception for the situation described.       

Your "demo" program that uses TestScores needs to handle the exception and display a    

message that an error has occurred.                                              

Make sure you follow the conventions listed in section 13.5 to separate the class   

specification from the implementation.
